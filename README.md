# Crop Yield Prediction System

This project is a Crop Yield Prediction System built using Flask and machine learning models.
The application predicts the crop yield based on various input parameters such as year, average rainfall, pesticides used, average temperature, area, and item (crop).

## Features
- Predict crop yield based on inputs such as year, average rainfall, pesticides usage, average temperature, area, and item.
- User-friendly interface for easy input and prediction visualization.
- Integration with machine learning models for accurate predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
